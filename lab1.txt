1) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the same system call interface for manipulating both file and devices?

The advantages of using the same system call interface for manipulating both file and devices is that devices are often handled as though it is a file system. The only differences are the device driver needs to be implemented by adding the hardware specific code. 

The disadvantages would be understanding the specific functions of a specific device.

2) Would it be possible for the user to develop a new command interpreter using the system call interface provided by the operating system? How?
